scaffolding new api project
dotnet new webapi -n [name_of_the_project]

add packages [to csroj]
dotnet add package [package_name]

[
    note: we will change command service local port number because it is same with platform service's port, it will throw error if both are same.

*** NOTE:
If there are multiple project running on same session in vs code, vs code intellisense does not work.
Solution: open project seperately in vs code

Creating platform from PlatformService was OK but informing CommandService about it was NOT OK!
Error: "The remote certificate is invalid because of errors in the certificate chain: UntrustedRoot"

So I did this (in CommandService): 

dotnet dev-certs https --clean (Clean certificates)
dotnet dev-certs https	       (Add certificate for CommandService localhost)	
dotnet dev-certs https --trust (Trust certificate which is you create)
